# Sky

This is a music runner game, made as a part of my experience with Motion Capture/[Qualisys-Unity-SDK](https://youtu.be/sJ28qc3-nIM) , Unity 3D and SuperCollider. The player controls the game by moving the marker. Motion data is captured by Motion capture in Unity. The player plays in real-time.

Here is how it’s done: data (marker positions) is sent to the SuperCollider from Unity. This data generates the pitch of a sounding note (Frequenz). And in SuperCollider the sound is synthesized by using a programming language.

Thus, the game is not only a runner, but a real-time musical instrument that can also sound like a Theremin.
